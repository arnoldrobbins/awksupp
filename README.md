# A Supplemental Document For Awk

This document circulated widely on USENET in the mid-1980s.
At the time, there was only the fairly skimpy documentation on
`awk` that came with V7 Unix.  This document provided a
number of additional details about how `awk` worked.

I'm putting it up on GitHub to preserve this interesting
bit of Unix / USENET history.
