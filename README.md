# A Supplemental Document For Awk

This document circulated widely on USENET in the mid-1980s.
At the time, there was only the fairly skimpy documentation on
`awk` that came with V7 Unix.  This document provided a
number of additional details about how `awk` worked.

I've included a note from Mark Weiser about using `double` instead
of `float`.

The current version was retrieved from
[https://article.olduse.net/4070%40sdcsvax.UCSD.EDU](olduset.net).
It has few additional bits of info from the first version I
put into this repository.

John Pierce's note from 1989 about his document is also included.
It came from
[https://article.olduse.net/431%40chem.ucsd.EDU](olduse.net) also.
Thanks to Adam Sjøgren for finding these two items.

I'm putting the document up on GitHub to preserve this interesting
bit of Unix / USENET history.
