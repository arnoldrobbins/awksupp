One undocumented aspect of Awk that John fails to mention in his otherwise
superb update to the Awk documention is the use of single precision floats
to represent all Awk numbers.  This means that if you are using awk
to balance your checkbook, and an intermediate sum ever gets to around
$50,000.00, you will lose some digits.

So that you can balance even the government's checkbook, recompile
Awk with AWKFLOAT redefined to 'double' in the file awk.def.
